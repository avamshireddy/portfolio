        <p>At Facebook, your birthday helps us provide you with a better, safer, and more personalized experience. Here are a few reasons why we ask for your birthday:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Age-appropriate Content:</b> We use your birthday to ensure you see content that is appropriate for your age group.</li>
            <li><b>Account Security:</b> Your birthday helps us verify your identity and keep your account secure.</li>
            <li><b>Personalized Experience:</b> We use your birthday to provide you with a more personalized experience, including birthday reminders for your friends.</li>
            <li><b>Legal Requirements:</b> We need to ensure that we are compliant with laws and regulations that restrict the use of our service based on age.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We value your privacy and take it seriously. For more information on how we use your data, please review our <a href="privacy_policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
